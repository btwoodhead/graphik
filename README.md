Graphik
=======

Make simple charts quickly.

Graphik was built to let journalists rapidly build chart images with a predefined visual style, without needing special software and a team of graphic designers.


Examples

Usage
-----

Try it here: [http://labs.thebureauinvestigates.com/graphik] (http://labs.thebureauinvestigates.com/graphik)

Paste your data in, configure the title and other furniture, then export an image file. If necessary the image could then be imported into Adobe Illustrator for any final touches.


Customising
-----------

Unlike [other chart-creating tools] (#similar-tools) Graphik makes it is easy to customise the style of the charts it creates. By default, Graphik uses the house style of [the Bureau of Investigative Journalism] (http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/), but you can easily customise it to your own. To do so:

1. Fork this repository.
2. In your forked version edit `vendor-style.css`, which defines the colours, fonts, and other stylistic elements, and `vendor-layout.json`, which controls how the different elements of the chart are postioned.
3. You can now use your customised version at: `http://<YOUR-ACCOUNT>.github.io/graphik`.
