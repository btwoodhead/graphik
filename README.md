Graphik
=======

Make simple charts quickly.

Graphik was built to let journalists rapidly build chart images with a predefined visual style, without needing special software and a team of graphic designers.


Usage
-----

Try it here: [http://tbij.github.io/graphik] (http://tbij.github.io/graphik)

Paste your data in, configure the title and other furniture, and export either a PNG or SVG file. If necessary an SVG can then be imported into Adobe Illustrator for final touches.


Customising
-----------

Unlike [other chart-creating tools] (#similar-tools) Graphik makes it is easy to customise the style of the charts it creates. By default, Graphik uses the house style of [the Bureau of Investigative Journalism] (http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/), but you can easily customise it to your own.

1. Fork this repository.
2. In your forked version edit `vendor-style.css`, which defines the colours, fonts, and other stylistic elements, and `vendor-layout.json`, which controls how the different elements of the chart are postioned.
3. You can now use your customised version at: `http://<YOUR-ACCOUNT>.github.io/graphik`.
